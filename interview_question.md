1. What Is Overfitting, and How Can You Avoid It? 
=> The model only fit on the training data not on the test data, to avoid we drop out to make model simple or change the learning rate.
   Test (cross-validation k folds) => danh gia toan bo data.

2. What Is Underfitting, and How Can You Avoid It? 
=> The model neither fit on the training data nor on the test data. To avoid we train model with more time, train with more data, make model more complex. 

3. What Are the Different Types of Machine Learning?
=> Sup, Unsup, Reinforcement 

4. How Do You Handle Missing or Corrupted (khong doc dc) Data in a Dataset?
=> Remove, Mean, Lay thang pho bien nha, Random by Gaussian

5. Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
=> Deep learning is belong to Machine Learning, Deep Learning based on Neural Network, it needs more data, strong computer. 
   Deep learning can learn features by itself, Machine Learning does it manually.
   
6. Decission tree vs Random Forest 
=> Decission tree trains from root, Random Forest has many trees 

7. Whatâ€™s the trade-off between bias and variance?
=> Minimum bias & minimum variance => Balance
